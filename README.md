Hi, I'm Max. Welcome to my repository!

My Chinese name is Pengyao Zhao. My preferred email is [pengyao.zhao@smu.ca](mailto:pengyao.zhao@smu.ca). My A-number is A00476491.

## Technology Interests

I have a keen interest in the following technologies:
- **Business Intelligence**
- **Data Analytics**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing**

I have used Tableau to analyze and visualize stock prices to support my investment decisions. Additionally, I use AI tools in daily life, such as clarifying low-resolution images, creating 3D profiles of my family, real-time English translation, LLM-based information research, and so on.

## Fun Fact

Here's a fun fact for you: 

When you're driving on a congested road with two lanes, you might often find that your lane is slower than the other. You might think it's just bad luck, but there's a scientific explanation. In fact, the slower lane often has more vehicles, so your car is more likely to be in the lane with more cars. Hahaha.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions!
